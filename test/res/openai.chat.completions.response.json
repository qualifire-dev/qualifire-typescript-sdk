Ye can sail the seas without 'em, for JavaScript has a trick up its sleeve called \"Automatic Semicolon Insertion\" which can save yer ship from wreckin'. But beware, ye might run into stormy seas if ye rely too much on it. Some say it's safer to keep 'em on deck, as they help avoid confusion 'n errors that might arise from JavaScript's black magic. So, if ye wish to sail smoothly, it's wise to use semicolons, but ye can get by without 'em if ye mind the winds 'n keep a sharp lookout! Yarrr!",
